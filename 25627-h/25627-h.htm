<div class="bk0"><h1><big>THE<br />
HUNTED<br />
HEROES</big></h1>

<h2>By ROBERT SILVERBERG</h2></div>

<div class="bk1"><p><i>The planet itself was tough enough&mdash;barren, desolate,
forbidding; enough to stop the most adventurous and
dedicated. But they had to run head-on against a mad
genius who had a motto:</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Death to all Terrans!</i></p></div>

<hr class="fx" />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Let's</span> keep moving," I told
Val. "The surest way to
die out here on Mars is to
give up." I reached over and
turned up the pressure on her
oxymask to make things a
little easier for her. Through
the glassite of the mask, I
could see her face contorted
in an agony of fatigue.</p>

<p>And she probably thought
the failure of the sandcat was
all my fault, too. Val's usually
about the best wife a guy
could ask for, but when she
wants to be she can be a real
flying bother.</p>

<p>It was beyond her to see
that some grease monkey back
at the Dome was at fault&mdash;whoever
it was who had failed
to fasten down the engine
hood. Nothing but what had
stopped us <i>could</i> stop a sandcat:
sand in the delicate
mechanism of the atomic engine.</p>

<p>But no; she blamed it all on
me somehow: So we were out
walking on the spongy sand
of the Martian desert. We'd
been walking a good eight
hours.</p>

<p>"Can't we turn back now,
Ron?" Val pleaded. "Maybe
there isn't any uranium in
this sector at all. I think
we're crazy to keep on searching
out here!"</p>

<p>I started to tell her that the
UranCo chief had assured me
we'd hit something out this
way, but changed my mind.
When Val's tired and overwrought
there's no sense in
arguing with her.</p>

<p>I stared ahead at the bleak,
desolate wastes of the Martian
landscape. Behind us
somewhere was the comfort
of the Dome, ahead nothing
but the mazes and gullies of
this dead world.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/001.png" width="331" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>He was a cripple in a wheelchair&mdash;helpless as a rattlesnake.</small></b></div>

<p>"Try to keep going, Val."
My gloved hand reached out
and clumsily enfolded hers.
"Come on, kid. Remember&mdash;we're
doing this for Earth.
We're heroes."</p>

<p>She glared at me. "Heroes,
hell!" she muttered. "That's
the way it looked back home,
but, out there it doesn't seem
so glorious. And UranCo's
pay is stinking."</p>

<p>"We didn't come out here
for the pay, Val."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, but just
the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>It must have been hell for
her. We had wandered fruitlessly
over the red sands all
day, both of us listening for
the clicks of the counter. And
the geigers had been obstinately
hushed all day, except
for their constant undercurrent
of meaningless noises.</p>

<p>Even though the Martian
gravity was only a fraction of
Earth's, I was starting to
tire, and I knew it must have
been really rough on Val with
her lovely but unrugged legs.</p>

<p>"Heroes," she said bitterly.
"We're not heroes&mdash;we're
suckers! Why did I ever let
you volunteer for the Geig
Corps and drag me along?"</p>

<p>Which wasn't anywhere
close to the truth. Now I
knew she was at the breaking
point, because Val didn't lie
unless she was so exhausted
she didn't know what she was
doing. She had been just as
much inflamed by the idea of
coming to Mars to help in the
search for uranium as I was.
We knew the pay was poor,
but we had felt it a sort of
obligation, something we
could do as individuals to
keep the industries of radioactives-starved
Earth going.
And we'd always had a roving
foot, both of us.</p>

<p>No, we had decided together
to come to Mars&mdash;the
way we decided together on
everything. Now she was
turning against me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I tried to jolly her. "Buck
up, kid," I said. I didn't dare
turn up her oxy pressure any
higher, but it was obvious she
couldn't keep going. She was
almost sleep-walking now.</p>

<p>We pressed on over the
barren terrain. The geiger
kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,
but never broke into
that sudden explosive tumult
that meant we had found pay-dirt.
I started to feel tired
myself, terribly tired. I longed
to lie down on the soft,
spongy Martian sand and
bury myself.</p>

<p>I looked at Val. She was
dragging along with her eyes
half-shut. I felt almost guilty
for having dragged her out to
Mars, until I recalled that I
hadn't. In fact, she had come
up with the idea before I did.
I wished there was some way
of turning the weary, bedraggled
girl at my side back into
the Val who had so enthusiastically
suggested we join
the Geigs.</p>

<p>Twelve steps later, I decided
this was about as far as
we could go.</p>

<p>I stopped, slipped out of
the geiger harness, and lowered
myself ponderously to
the ground. "What'samatter,
Ron?" Val asked sleepily.
"Something wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, baby," I said, putting
out a hand and taking hers.
"I think we ought to rest a
little before we go any further.
It's been a long, hard
day."</p>

<p>It didn't take much to persuade
her. She slid down beside
me, curled up, and in a
moment she was fast asleep,
sprawled out on the sands.</p>

<p><i>Poor kid</i>, I thought. Maybe
we shouldn't have come to
Mars after all. But, I reminded
myself, <i>someone</i> had to do
the job.</p>

<p>A second thought appeared,
but I squelched it:</p>

<p>Why the hell me?</p>

<p>I looked down at Valerie's
sleeping form, and thought of
our warm, comfortable little
home on Earth. It wasn't
much, but people in love don't
need very fancy surroundings.</p>

<p>I watched her, sleeping
peacefully, a wayward lock of
her soft blonde hair trailing
down over one eyebrow, and
it seemed hard to believe that
we'd exchanged Earth and all
it held for us for the raw, untamed
struggle that was Mars.
But I knew I'd do it again, if
I had the chance. It's because
we wanted to keep what we
had. Heroes? Hell, no. We
just liked our comforts, and
wanted to keep them. Which
took a little work.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Time to get moving.</i> But
then Val stirred and rolled
over in her sleep, and I didn't
have the heart to wake her. I
sat there, holding her, staring
out over the desert, watching
the wind whip the sand up
into weird shapes.</p>

<p>The Geig Corps preferred
married couples, working in
teams. That's what had finally
decided it for us&mdash;we were a
good team. We had no ties on
Earth that couldn't be broken
without much difficulty. So
we volunteered.</p>

<p><i>And here we are.</i> Heroes.
The wind blasted a mass of
sand into my face, and I felt
it tinkle against the oxymask.</p>

<p>I glanced at the suit-chronometer.
Getting late. I decided
once again to wake Val.
But she was tired. And I was
tired too, tired from our
wearying journey across the
empty desert.</p>

<p>I started to shake Val. But
I never finished. It would be
<i>so</i> nice just to lean back and
nuzzle up to her, down in the
sand. So nice. I yawned, and
stretched back.</p>

<hr />

<p>I awoke with a sudden startled
shiver, and realized angrily
I had let myself doze off.
"Come on, Val," I said savagely,
and started to rise to
my feet.</p>

<p>I couldn't.</p>

<p>I looked down. I was neatly
bound in thin, tough, plastic
tangle-cord, swathed from
chin to boot-bottoms, my
arms imprisoned, my feet
caught. And tangle-cord is
about as easy to get out of as
a spider's web is for a trapped
fly.</p>

<p>It wasn't Martians that
had done it. There weren't
any Martians, hadn't been for
a million years. It was some
Earthman who had bound us.</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes toward
Val, and saw that she was
similarly trussed in the sticky
stuff. The tangle-cord was still
fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant
odor like that of drying
fish. It had been spun on
us only a short time ago, I
realized.</p>

<p>"Ron&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't try to move, baby.
This stuff can break your
neck if you twist it wrong."
She continued for a moment
to struggle futilely, and I had
to snap, "Lie still, Val!"</p>

<p>"A very wise statement,"
said a brittle, harsh voice
from above me. I looked up
and saw a helmeted figure
above us. He wasn't wearing
the customary skin-tight pliable
oxysuits we had. He
wore an outmoded, bulky
spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,
all but the face area
opaque. The oxygen cannisters
weren't attached to his
back as expected, though.
They were strapped to the
back of the wheelchair in
which he sat.</p>

<p>Through the fishbowl I
could see hard little eyes, a
yellowed, parchment-like face,
a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize
him, and this struck me
odd. I thought I knew everyone
on sparsely-settled Mars.
Somehow I'd missed him.</p>

<p>What shocked me most was
that he had no legs. The
spacesuit ended neatly at the
thighs.</p>

<p>He was holding in his left
hand the tanglegun with
which he had entrapped us,
and a very efficient-looking
blaster was in his right.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to disturb
your sleep," he said coldly.
"So I've been waiting here
for you to wake up."</p>

<p>I could just see it. He might
have been sitting there for
hours, complacently waiting
to see how we'd wake up.
That was when I realized he
must be totally insane. I could
feel my stomach-muscles
tighten, my throat constrict
painfully.</p>

<p>Then anger ripped through
me, washing away the terror.
"What's going on?" I demanded,
staring at the half
of a man who confronted us
from the wheelchair. "Who
are you?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out soon
enough," he said. "Suppose
now you come with me." He
reached for the tanglegun,
flipped the little switch on its
side to MELT, and shot a
stream of watery fluid over
our legs, keeping the blaster
trained on us all the while.
Our legs were free.</p>

<p>"You may get up now," he
said. "Slowly, without trying
to make trouble." Val and I
helped each other to our feet
as best we could, considering
our arms were still tightly
bound against the sides of our
oxysuits.</p>

<p>"Walk," the stranger said,
waving the tanglegun to indicate
the direction. "I'll be
right behind you." He holstered
the tanglegun.</p>

<p>I glimpsed the bulk of an
outboard atomic rigging behind
him, strapped to the
back of the wheelchair. He
fingered a knob on the arm of
the chair and the two exhaust
ducts behind the wheel-housings
flamed for a moment,
and the chair began to roll.</p>

<p>Obediently, we started
walking. You don't argue
with a blaster, even if the
man pointing it is in a wheelchair.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What's going on, Ron?"
Val asked in a low voice as we
walked. Behind us the wheelchair
hissed steadily.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know, Val.
I've never seen this guy before,
and I thought I knew
everyone at the Dome."</p>

<p>"Quiet up there!" our captor
called, and we stopped
talking. We trudged along together,
with him following
behind; I could hear the
<i>crunch-crunch</i> of the wheelchair
as its wheels chewed
into the sand. I wondered
where we were going, and
why. I wondered why we had
ever left Earth.</p>

<p>The answer to that came to
me quick enough: we had to.
Earth needed radioactives,
and the only way to get them
was to get out and look. The
great atomic wars of the late
20th Century had used up
much of the supply, but the
amount used to blow up half
the great cities of the world
hardly compared with the
amount we needed to put
them back together again.</p>

<p>In three centuries the shattered
world had been completely
rebuilt. The wreckage
of New York and Shanghai
and London and all the other
ruined cities had been hidden
by a shining new world of
gleaming towers and flying
roadways. We had profited by
our grandparents' mistakes.
They had used their atomics
to make bombs. We used ours
for fuel.</p>

<p>It was an atomic world.
Everything: power drills,
printing presses, typewriters,
can openers, ocean liners,
powered by the inexhaustible
energy of the dividing atom.</p>

<p>But though the energy is
inexhaustible, the supply of
nuclei isn't. After three centuries
of heavy consumption,
the supply failed. The mighty
machine that was Earth's industry
had started to slow
down.</p>

<p>And that started the chain
of events that led Val and me
to end up as a madman's prisoners,
on Mars. With every
source of uranium mined dry
on Earth, we had tried other
possibilities. All sorts of
schemes came forth. Project
Sea-Dredge was trying to get
uranium from the oceans. In
forty or fifty years, they'd
get some results, we hoped.
But there wasn't forty or
fifty years' worth of raw stuff
to tide us over until then. In a
decade or so, our power would
be just about gone. I could
picture the sort of dog-eat-dog
world we'd revert back
to. Millions of starving, freezing
humans tooth-and-clawing
in it in the useless shell of
a great atomic civilization.</p>

<p>So, Mars. There's not much
uranium on Mars, and it's not
easy to find or any cinch to
mine. But what little is there,
helps. It's a stopgap effort,
just to keep things moving
until Project Sea-Dredge
starts functioning.</p>

<p>Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers
out on the face of
Mars, combing for its uranium
deposits.</p>

<p>And here we are, I thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>After we walked on a
while, a Dome became visible
up ahead. It slid up over the
crest of a hill, set back between
two hummocks on the
desert. Just out of the way
enough to escape observation.</p>

<p>For a puzzled moment I
thought it was our Dome, the
settlement where all of UranCo's
Geig Corps were located,
but another look told me that
this was actually quite near
us and fairly small. A one-man
Dome, of all things!</p>

<p>"Welcome to my home," he
said. "The name is Gregory
Ledman." He herded us off to
one side of the airlock, uttered
a few words keyed to his
voice, and motioned us inside
when the door slid up. When
we were inside he reached up,
clumsily holding the blaster,
and unscrewed the ancient
spacesuit fishbowl.</p>

<p>His face was a bitter,
dried-up mask. He was a man
who hated.</p>

<p>The place was spartanly
furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,
no decoration of any
sort. Hard bulkhead walls,
rivet-studded, glared back
at us. He had an automatic
chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,
and no other furniture.</p>

<p>Suddenly he drew the tanglegun
and sprayed our legs
again. We toppled heavily to
the floor. I looked up angrily.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I imagine you want to
know the whole story," he
said. "The others did, too."</p>

<p>Valerie looked at me anxiously.
Her pretty face was a
dead white behind her oxymask.
"What others?"</p>

<p>"I never bothered to find
out their names," Ledman
said casually. "They were
other Geigs I caught unawares,
like you, out on the
desert. That's the only sport I
have left&mdash;Geig-hunting. Look
out there."</p>

<p>He gestured through the
translucent skin of the Dome,
and I felt sick. There was a
little heap of bones lying
there, looking oddly bright
against the redness of the
sands. They were the dried,
parched skeletons of Earthmen.
Bits of cloth and plastic,
once oxymasks and suits, still
clung to them.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered.
There had been a pattern
there all the time. We didn't
much talk about it; we chalked
it off as occupational hazards.
There had been a pattern
of disappearances on the desert.
I could think of six, eight
names now. None of them
had been particularly close
friends. You don't get time to
make close friends out here.
But we'd vowed it wouldn't
happen to us.</p>

<p>It had.</p>

<p>"You've been hunting
Geigs?" I asked. "<i>Why?</i>
What've they ever done to
you?"</p>

<p>He smiled, as calmly as if
I'd just praised his house-keeping.
"Because I hate
you," he said blandly. "I intend
to wipe every last one of
you out, one by one."</p>

<p>I stared at him. I'd never
seen a man like this before; I
thought all his kind had died
at the time of the atomic
wars.</p>

<p>I heard Val sob, "He's a
madman!"</p>

<p>"No," Ledman said evenly.
"I'm quite sane, believe me.
But I'm determined to drive
the Geigs&mdash;and UranCo&mdash;off
Mars. Eventually I'll scare
you all away."</p>

<p>"Just pick us off in the desert?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Ledman.
"And I have no fears of an
armed attack. This place is
well fortified. I've devoted
years to building it. And I'm
back against those hills. They
couldn't pry me out." He let
his pale hand run up into his
gnarled hair. "I've devoted
years to this. Ever since&mdash;ever
since I landed here on
Mars."</p>

<hr />

<p>"What are you going to do
with us?" Val finally asked,
after a long silence.</p>

<p>He didn't smile this time.
"Kill you," he told her. "Not
your husband. I want him as
an envoy, to go back and tell
the others to clear off." He
rocked back and forth in his
wheelchair, toying with the
gleaming, deadly blaster in
his hand.</p>

<p>We stared in horror. It was
a nightmare&mdash;sitting there,
placidly rocking back and
forth, a nightmare.</p>

<p>I found myself fervently
wishing I was back out there
on the infinitely safer desert.</p>

<p>"Do I shock you?" he asked.
"I shouldn't&mdash;not when
you see my motives."</p>

<p>"We don't see them," I
snapped.</p>

<p>"Well, let me show you.
You're on Mars hunting uranium,
right? To mine and
ship the radioactives back to
Earth to keep the atomic engines
going. Right?"</p>

<p>I nodded over at our geiger
counters.</p>

<p>"We volunteered to come to
Mars," Val said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;two young heroes,"
Ledman said acidly. "How
sad. I could almost feel sorry
for you. Almost."</p>

<p>"Just what is it you're
after?" I said, stalling, stalling.</p>

<p>"Atomics cost me my legs,"
he said. "You remember the
Sadlerville Blast?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course." And I did, too.
I'd never forget it. No one
would. How could I forget
that great accident&mdash;killing
hundreds, injuring thousands
more, sterilizing forty miles
of Mississippi land&mdash;when
the Sadlerville pile went up?</p>

<p>"I was there on business at
the time," Ledman said. "I
represented Ledman Atomics.
I was there to sign a new
contract for my company.
You know who I am, now?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I was fairly well shielded
when it happened. I never got
the contract, but I got a good
dose of radiation instead. Not
enough to kill me," he said.
"Just enough to necessitate
the removal of&mdash;" he indicated
the empty space at his
thighs. "So I got off lightly."
He gestured at the wheelchair
blanket.</p>

<p>I still didn't understand.
"But why kill us Geigs? <i>We</i>
had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"You're just in this by accident,"
he said. "You see, after
the explosion and the amputation,
my fellow-members on
the board of Ledman Atomics
decided that a semi-basket
case like myself was a poor
risk as Head of the Board,
and they took my company
away. All quite legal, I assure
you. They left me almost a
pauper!" Then he snapped
the punchline at me.</p>

<p>"They renamed Ledman
Atomics. Who did you say you
worked for?"</p>

<p>I began, "Uran&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother. A more inventive
title than Ledman
Atomics, but not quite as
much heart, wouldn't you
say?" He grinned. "I saved
for years; then I came to
Mars, lost myself, built this
Dome, and swore to get even.
There's not a great deal of
uranium on this planet, but
enough to keep me in a style
to which, unfortunately, I'm
no longer accustomed."</p>

<hr />

<p>He consulted his wrist
watch. "Time for my injection."
He pulled out the tanglegun
and sprayed us again,
just to make doubly certain.
"That's another little souvenir
of Sadlerville. I'm short
on red blood corpuscles."</p>

<p>He rolled over to a wall
table and fumbled in a container
among a pile of hypodermics.
"There are other injections,
too. Adrenalin, insulin.
Others. The Blast turned
me into a walking pin-cushion.
But I'll pay it all
back," he said. He plunged
the needle into his arm.</p>

<p>My eyes widened. It was
too nightmarish to be real. I
wasn't seriously worried
about his threat to wipe out
the entire Geig Corps, since
it was unlikely that one man
in a wheelchair could pick us
all off. No, it wasn't the
threat that disturbed me, so
much as the whole concept, so
strange to me, that the human
mind could be as warped
and twisted as Ledman's.</p>

<p>I saw the horror on Val's
face, and I knew she felt the
same way I did.</p>

<p>"Do you really think you
can succeed?" I taunted him.
"Really think you can kill
every Earthman on Mars? Of
all the insane, cockeyed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Val's quick, worried head-shake
cut me off. But Ledman
had felt my words, all right.</p>

<p>"Yes! I'll get even with
every one of you for taking
away my legs! If we hadn't
meddled with the atom in the
first place, I'd be as tall and
powerful as you, today&mdash;instead
of a useless cripple in a
wheelchair."</p>

<p>"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,"
Val said quietly.
"You've conceived an impossible
scheme of revenge and
now you're taking it out on
innocent people who've done
nothing, nothing at all to you.
That's not sane!"</p>

<p>His eyes blazed. "Who are
you to talk of sanity?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Uneasily I caught Val's
glance from a corner of my
eye. Sweat was rolling down
her smooth forehead faster
than the auto-wiper could
swab it away.</p>

<p>"Why don't you do something?
What are you waiting
for, Ron?"</p>

<p>"Easy, baby," I said. I
knew what our ace in the hole
was. But I had to get Ledman
within reach of me first.</p>

<p>"Enough," he said. "I'm going
to turn you loose outside,
right after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Get sick!</i>" I hissed to Val,
low. She began immediately
to cough violently, emitting
harsh, choking sobs. "Can't
breathe!" She began to yell,
writhing in her bonds.</p>

<p>That did it. Ledman hadn't
much humanity left in him,
but there was a little. He lowered
the blaster a bit and
wheeled one-hand over to see
what was wrong with Val.
She continued to retch and
moan most horribly. It almost
convinced me. I saw Val's
pale, frightened face turn to
me.</p>

<p>He approached and peered
down at her. He opened his
mouth to say something, and
at that moment I snapped my
leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord
with a snicking rasp,
and kicked his wheelchair
over.</p>

<p>The blaster went off, burning
a hole through the Dome
roof. The automatic sealers
glued-in instantly. Ledman
went sprawling helplessly out
into the middle of the floor,
the wheelchair upended next
to him, its wheels slowly revolving
in the air. The blaster
flew from his hands at the
impact of landing and spun
out near me. In one quick motion
I rolled over and covered
it with my body.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ledman clawed his way to
me with tremendous effort
and tried wildly to pry the
blaster out from under me,
but without success. I twisted
a bit, reached out with my
free leg, and booted him
across the floor. He fetched
up against the wall of the
Dome and lay there.</p>

<p>Val rolled over to me.</p>

<p>"Now if I could get free of
this stuff," I said, "I could get
him covered before he comes
to. But how?"</p>

<p>"Teamwork," Val said. She
swivelled around on the floor
until her head was near my
boot. "Push my oxymask off
with your foot, if you can."</p>

<p>I searched for the clamp
and tried to flip it. No luck,
with my heavy, clumsy boot.
I tried again, and this time it
snapped open. I got the tip
of my boot in and pried upward.
The oxymask came off,
slowly, scraping a jagged red
scratch up the side of Val's
neck as it came.</p>

<p>"There," she breathed.
"That's that."</p>

<p>I looked uneasily at Ledman.
He was groaning and
beginning to stir.</p>

<p>Val rolled on the floor and
her face lay near my right
arm. I saw what she had in
mind. She began to nibble the
vile-tasting tangle-cord, running
her teeth up and down
it until it started to give. She
continued unfailingly.</p>

<p>Finally one strand snapped.
Then another. At last I
had enough use of my hand
to reach out and grasp the
blaster. Then I pulled myself
across the floor to Ledman,
removed the tanglegun, and
melted the remaining tangle-cord
off.</p>

<p>My muscles were stiff and
bunched, and rising made me
wince. I turned and freed Val.
Then I turned and faced Ledman.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll kill me
now," he said.</p>

<p>"No. That's the difference
between sane people and insane,"
I told him. "I'm not
going to kill you at all. I'm
going to see to it that you're
sent back to Earth."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" he shouted. "No!
Anything but back there. I
don't want to face them again&mdash;not
after what they did to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so loud," I broke in.
"They'll help you on Earth.
They'll take all the hatred and
sickness out of you, and turn
you into a useful member of
society again."</p>

<p>"I hate Earthmen," he spat
out. "I hate all of them."</p>

<p>"I know," I said sarcastically.
"You're just all full of
hate. You hated us so much
that you couldn't bear to hang
around on Earth for as much
as a year after the Sadlerville
Blast. You had to take right
off for Mars without a moment's
delay, didn't you? You
hated Earth so much you <i>had</i>
to leave."</p>

<p>"Why are you telling all
this to me?"</p>

<p>"Because if you'd stayed
long enough, you'd have used
some of your pension money
to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic
legs, and then you
wouldn't need this wheelchair."</p>

<p>Ledman scowled, and then
his face went belligerent
again. "They told me I was
paralyzed below the waist.
That I'd never walk again,
even with prosthetic legs, because
I had no muscles to fit
them to."</p>

<p>"You left Earth too quickly,"
Val said.</p>

<p>"It was the only way," he
protested. "I had to get off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's right," I told him.
"The atom can take away, but
it can give as well. Soon after
you left they developed
<i>atomic-powered</i> prosthetics&mdash;amazing
things, virtually robot
legs. All the survivors of
the Sadlerville Blast were
given the necessary replacement
limbs free of charge. All
except you. You were so sick
you had to get away from the
world you despised and come
here."</p>

<p>"You're lying," he said.
"It's not true!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but it is," Val smiled.</p>

<p>I saw him wilt visibly, and
for a moment I almost felt
sorry for him, a pathetic legless
figure propped up against
the wall of the Dome at
blaster-point. But then I remembered
he'd killed twelve
Geigs&mdash;or more&mdash;and would
have added Val to the number
had he had the chance.</p>

<hr />

<p>"You're a very sick man,
Ledman," I said. "All this
time you could have been
happy, useful on Earth, instead
of being holed up here
nursing your hatred. You
might have been useful, on
Earth. But you decided to
channel everything out as revenge."</p>

<p>"I still don't believe it&mdash;those
legs. I might have walked
again. No&mdash;no, it's all a lie.
They told me I'd never walk,"
he said, weakly but stubbornly
still.</p>

<p>I could see his whole structure
of hate starting to topple,
and I decided to give it
the final push.</p>

<p>"Haven't you wondered
how I managed to break the
tangle-cord when I kicked you
over?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;human legs aren't
strong enough to break tangle-cord
that way."</p>

<p>"Of course not," I said. I
gave Val the blaster and slipped
out of my oxysuit.
"Look," I said. I pointed to
my smooth, gleaming metal
legs. The almost soundless
purr of their motors was the
only noise in the room. "I was
in the Sadlerville Blast, too,"
I said. "But I didn't go crazy
with hate when I lost <i>my</i>
legs."</p>

<p>Ledman was sobbing.</p>

<p>"Okay, Ledman," I said.
Val got him into his suit, and
brought him the fishbowl helmet.
"Get your helmet on and
let's go. Between the psychs
and the prosthetics men,
you'll be a new man inside of
a year."</p>

<p>"But I'm a murderer!"</p>

<p>"That's right. And you'll be
sentenced to psych adjustment.
When they're finished,
Gregory Ledman the killer
will be as dead as if they'd
electrocuted you, but there'll
be a new&mdash;and sane&mdash;Gregory
Ledman." I turned to Val.</p>

<p>"Got the geigers, honey?"</p>

<p>For the first time since
Ledman had caught us, I remembered
how tired Val had
been out on the desert. I realized
now that I had been driving
her mercilessly&mdash;me, with
my chromium legs and atomic-powered
muscles. No wonder
she was ready to fold!
And I'd been too dense to see
how unfair I had been.</p>

<p>She lifted the geiger harnesses,
and I put Ledman
back in his wheelchair.</p>

<p>Val slipped her oxymask
back on and fastened it shut.</p>

<p>"Let's get back to the Dome
in a hurry," I said. "We'll
turn Ledman over to the authorities.
Then we can catch
the next ship for Earth."</p>

<p>"Go back? <i>Go back?</i> If you
think I'm backing down now
and quitting you can find
yourself another wife! After
we dump this guy I'm sacking
in for twenty hours, and then
we're going back out there to
finish that search-pattern.
Earth needs uranium, honey,
and I know you'd never be
happy quitting in the middle
like that." She smiled. "I
can't wait to get out there
and start listening for those
tell-tale clicks."</p>

<p>I gave a joyful whoop and
swung her around. When I
put her down, she squeezed
my hand, hard.</p>

<p>"Let's get moving, fellow
hero," she said.</p>

<p>I pressed the stud for the
airlock, smiling.</p>
